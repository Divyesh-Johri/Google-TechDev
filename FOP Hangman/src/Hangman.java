 * (https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs106a/cs106a.1124/handouts/200%20Assignment%204.pdf)
 * 
 * Plays like traditional hangman (with the inclusion of feet -- 8 guesses), this class starts
 * as a stub with a console playable hangman using a list of words provided by HangmanLexicon. 
 * It will then include implementation with a GUI interface using the acm java package.
